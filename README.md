# Cookiecutter GeoAI

_A logical, reasonably standardized, but flexible project structure for doing and sharing GeoAI geographic data science work._

This cookiecutter template is designed to be used for GeoAI, geographic data science work utilizing ArcGIS Pro combined with Python machine learning technologies.

### Requirements to use the cookiecutter template:
-----------
 - Python 3.5 _with_ ArcPy
 - [Cookiecutter](http://cookiecutter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html) >= 1.4.0: This can be installed with Conda:

``` bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge cookiecutter
```


### To start a new project, run:
------------

``` bash
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/ArcGIS/geo-ai/tree/master/templates/cookiecutter-geoai-v0
```

### The resulting directory structure
------------

The directory structure of your new project will look like this:
