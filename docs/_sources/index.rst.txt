Cookiecutter-Spatial-Data-Science
==================================

This template integrates ArcGIS Pro projects and tools with data science workflows. Please
think of this template as a collection of best practices, and little more. Use what works, and remove what
does not. If you decide to change something, please just do it consistently in your project. This way when you
look at it in six months, *you* can still understand what you were doing, and so can *other* people.
