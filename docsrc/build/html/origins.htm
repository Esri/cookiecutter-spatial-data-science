<h1>Origins<a class="headerlink" href="#origins" title="Permalink to this heading">¶</a></h1>
<p>The Cookiecutter Spatial Data Science template arose out of a need for an experienced
geographer well versed in ArcGIS Pro and Python and a _very_ experienced data scientist
new to Esri (at the time) to figure out some way to collaboratively work together.</p>
<p>A team was being assembled at Esri to work with clients to utilize artificial
intelligence as part of the solution for solving geographic problems. We were working
with a number of different clients on a staggering variety of extremely interesting
projects.</p>
<p>My colleague, Daniel, and I had to interate quickly and collaboratively. This
collaboration was hampered by the time it took to set up each project, and also how
much time we were spending learning each others’ approach to project structure.
Even our respective project structures were evolving as our approaches were evolving
based on the needs of each project.</p>
<p>This ad-hoc approach hampered efficiency at best. In reality, it was frustratingly
cumbersome to start working on a new project, and difficult to return to a previous
project, since each one was different.</p>
<p>This frustration led us to begin using the Cookiecutter-Data-Science template, but
we quickly ran into some challenges when trying to marry ArcGIS Pro projects with
this new structure. Our evolution of this paradigm to integrate ArcGIS Pro projects
into the original template, add support for Windows environments, and use
Conda for Python environment management is the Cookiecutter-Spatial-Data-Science
template.</p>
